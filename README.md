## About Me

Hey! I'm Juan, a Colombian engineer currently pursuing my MS in Robotics at Northeastern University as a Fulbright scholar. I have dual degrees in Mechatronics and Industrial Engineering, which basically means I love building robots AND figuring out how to make them useful in real-world applications.

My journey has taken me from designing custom machines in Colombia to programming flight simulators for the Air Force, with a lot of freelance coding in between. These days, I'm focused on industrial automation - making manufacturing smarter with collaborative robots and automated systems.

## What I've Been Up To

**Built Cool Stuff**
- Designed a complete automated poultry processing machine from scratch (yes, it actually works in production)
- Developed flight simulator systems for the Colombian Air Force's AC47T trainer
- Created a knee rehabilitation device with my team - full medical device development from concept to prototype
- Currently building a WALL-E robot that can actually move and navigate autonomously

**Coded A Lot**
- Delivered 200+ projects on Fiverr with a perfect 5.0 rating (learned a ton about different industries)
- Built everything from automation scripts to full web applications
- Set up CI/CD pipelines that actually made people's lives easier

**Optimized Things**
- Simulated an entire 11,000mÂ² warehouse operation to find bottlenecks
- Made dual robots work together for pick-and-place operations
- Always looking for ways to make processes run better

## Tech Stack

**Hardware**: ABB Robots, Arduino, PIC Microcontrollers, 3D Printing  
**Software**: Python, C++, ROS, MATLAB, Java  
**Tools**: Fusion360, FlexSim, Git, Whatever gets the job done

## Achievements Worth Mentioning

- Won a few hackathons (Hunger4Innovation, ASIBEI International)
- Top 5 among 2,500 projects in IEEE Call for Code
- Graduated top 3 in my class (hence the Fulbright opportunity)
- Harvard CS50x certified (plus a bunch of other online courses)

## Current Focus

Working on industrial automation robotics for manufacturing lines. If it involves making robots do useful things in factories or warehouses, I'm interested. Currently seeking co-op opportunities for Summer/Fall 2025.

## Let's Connect

Always happy to chat about robotics, automation, or how to make things work better. Feel free to check out my projects below or reach out if you want to collaborate on something interesting.
